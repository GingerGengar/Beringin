Circuit Standards:
each intersection crossing has to be shown, there should be no ambiguous case whether two wires crossing each other like a + are connected to each other or is just a crossing. If the wires are connected a node[circ]{} will be used

Each Circuit should be anchored at the input. This allows the snippet of code to be portable ie, the input of a certain circuit could be placed at the output of another circuit. EG: circuit1 -> circuit2-> circuit3 -> .... -> circuitn

All necessary terminals such as the source voltage and drain voltage of an operational amplifier must be shown, as well as the corresponding voltages at those terminal. For example a device who theoretically works with 5 terminals must be represented with a figure with 5 terminals, for example, the op amp: source voltage, drain voltage, positive terminal, negative terminal, output terminal. 

As much as possible, use the same scaling for all of the circuits. Instead of making figures smaller to fit more complex circuits, instead assign a symbollic representation of the sub-system units, for example a low pass filter represented by a box with inside labelled "LP"










Dynamics notation conventions:
Basic Mathematical Objects
    Scalars
        length, time, mass, energy
    Vectors
        force, position, velocity, acceleration, momentum, moments, angles, angular velocity, angular acceleration, angular momentum
    Matrix
        Inertia tensor
Basic Operations
    frame derivative
    scalar multiplication
    dot product
    cross product



Vector Notation Conventions:
$${}^{A}_{C}\bar{v}^{B}_{D}$$
Let A represent top left superscript B top right superscript, C represent bottom left subscript, D represent bottom right subscript. Let the A,B,C,D be named specifiers. Workings should contain the least amount of specifiers needed, to allow for expression generality.
