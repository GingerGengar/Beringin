Fluid mechanics is indeed a very challenging subject, and there are still many phenomena that are yet to be explained properly, but this is an incredibly important subject in many engineering applications.

\\~\\The most obvious applicatio for fluid mechanics is in constructing aircrafts where we need to understand the aerodynamic forces acting on our vehicle.
Fluid mechanics have also been used in rocketry, re-entry vehicles, race cars, ships, sailing, wind turbines, jet engines, steam turbines, chemical plants, and more.
The steam turbine is a device that converts high pressure working fluid into mechanical energy and this is what practically powers almost all modern civilization. 
Do not underestimate the importance of fluid mechanics.

\\~\\Other than the practical aspects of fluid mechanics, fluid flows occuring in nature are incredibly intricate and complex. 
It is mesmerizing to see the many different scale structures of the fluid and we can easily get lost watching fluids behave in reality.
Certainly the world of fluid mechanics is bizarre, wide and interesting.
It will take a lot of hard work and perseverance but I can guarantee that the reward is well worth it.
